**Space Complexity Report**

The ISBN validation solution is implemented in the ISBN class, which contains the *isbn13()* method. This method takes a single input, a string representing the ISBN number, and returns a string indicating if the ISBN is valid or not. In the case of a valid ISBN-10, it returns the ISBN-13 conversion of the ISBN-10.

**Space Complexity Analysis**

The space complexity of the *isbn13()* method is O(1), as it does not use any data structures to store any additional information. The method only uses a few variables to store the sum and the check digit, and these variables take a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

The input ISBN is a string, and its space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the ISBN. However, the *isbn13()* method does not create any additional copies of the input ISBN, so it does not increase the space complexity.

In conclusion, the worst-case space complexity of the ISBN validation solution is O(1) + O(n) = O(n), where n is the length of the ISBN. This is because it only uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size, and the only
